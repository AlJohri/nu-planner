Data Strucures in nuPlanner

- PostgreSQL Database uses a B+ tree in the backend
- Arrays are used in the code for scraping Wildcat Connection for a list of organizations
- Arrays are used in the code for grabbing events from Facebook
- Linked List is used for storing JsonObjects and combining the multiple methods of FQL Queries
  to ensure that there are no duplicates.


In the view, what does one do with the events?
	- put events into view either based on date or day
	- filter events based on organization
	- request next day or next week of events
	- edit/view/remove particular events

"time" is not most important for data structure, date and day is more important
